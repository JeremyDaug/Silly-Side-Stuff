and various other things.
- Be relatively user friendly in it's interface to complete this.

Features
- Variant formation. Give the ability to take a word, discect it and see what each affix means in a grammatical sense.
- Random Word generation. Give the ability to create new words from scratch easily.
- Word construction. Make it easy to construct words from other words and syllables that already exist.
- Search functions to find almost anything one could need in either using or editing the language.

Possible other features
- Full translation, unlikely due to complexity of the task, but not impossible.
